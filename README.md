# A work in progress looking at fotball data from fotball.no

This is my current procastination project. I fetch data from fotball.no to see how different teams
performs during the season.

Run it by cloning the project and running app/main.py. This will start scraping fotball.no and saving some data
so that the next time you run the code it should not take minutes to finish.
