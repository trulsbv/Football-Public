# A work in progress looking at fotball data from transfermarkt.com

This is my current procastination project. I fetch data from transfermarkt.com to see how different teams performs during the season.

Required dependencies:
* pandas
* graphviz
* randomcolor
* matplotlib
* seaborn

Run it by cloning the project and running app/main.py. 
! THIS WILL BE SLOW THE FIRST TIME IT IS RUN !
The code downloads a lot of data from transfermarkt.com the first time it runs so it will
take a while depending on your internet connection. However, the second time the code runs
it will be much quicker.

To create the PDF beneath, run main.py with the flags: -2023 Eliteserien Norway

Some of the samples of the different graphs that can be automatically generated for every club based on transfermarkt data:
